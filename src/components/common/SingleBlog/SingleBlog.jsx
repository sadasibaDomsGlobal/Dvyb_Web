        {/* Introduction */}
        <div className="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most celebrated festivals in India and among Indian communities worldwide. It symbolises the victory of good over evil, commemorating Lord Rama's triumph over Ravana. Beyond its spiritual significance, Diwali is a time for joyous reunions with family and friends, filled with love, laughter, and, of course, festive attire. As with every celebration, Diwali provides the perfect occasion to embrace stunning traditional wear. This season, Taneira offers a curated collection of sarees designed to make you shine. Here's what to consider when choosing the perfect Diwali saree.</p>

            When selecting a saree for Diwali, the choice of colour plays a key role in setting the mood and creating a visual impact. Each colour has its own symbolism—red embodies strength and courage, yellow radiates joy and positivity, and white represents purity. For evening events, deeper tones like maroon, emerald, or navy lend a sense of grandeur, while pastels such as blush pink, mint green or sunshine yellow are perfect for daytime festivities. Consider not just the occasion but also what resonates with your personal taste and complements your complexion, allowing your saree to truly reflect your unique style.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The fabric of your saree is crucial for both comfort and style. Depending on the type of Diwali event—be it a casual gathering or a grand celebration—different fabrics will suit different moods. For intimate family get-togethers, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen offer relaxed elegance. For more festive, elaborate occasions, luxurious fabrics like silk, organza, or tissue add a touch of opulence. Consider the climate too; for warmer weather, lightweight georgette or chiffon sarees offer a flowing, graceful drape, while organza provides a more structured and regal look. The perfect fabric strikes a balance between elegance and ease, ensuring you feel both comfortable and chic.

            Diwali is the perfect time to showcase your individual style, and sarees offer endless options to express it. From regionally inspired weaves to contemporary designs, there's a saree for every festive occasion. For grand celebrations, opt for a stunning Kanjivaram or a heavily embroidered Banarasi saree to make a bold statement. For smaller, more casual events, a silk-cotton blend or a lightweight georgette saree offers understated charm. Whether you prefer traditional designs or modern silhouettes, choose a saree that resonates with your personal aesthetic and enhances your Diwali look.
